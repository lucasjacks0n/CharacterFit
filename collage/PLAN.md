I need to generate photos that are essentially collages out of multiple photos and have them laid out and arranged evenly

We will do this in python, each file will do their own thing, we will use images in test_images folder.

Part 1:
Create a python file that extracts products from their white space from test_images
extract.py
Save these files to ".out" directory within this folder

Part 2:
Next file i want to write arrange.py
I want to arrange all of these in an image 800 x 1000
I want them to be relatively proportional, 
Put them in collages folder
